🚀 Upgrading My Object Detection Game! 🚀


Just installed the super-powerful RTX 4080 GPU for my computer vision projects, and I'm excited to share the setup process with you all! 💪


🖥️ Setup Steps:

Install NVIDIA GPU Drivers:

Download and install the latest NVIDIA drivers from NVIDIA's official site.
Install CUDA Toolkit:

Download the CUDA Toolkit from the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit page.

Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.
Install cuDNN:

Go to the NVIDIA cuDNN page and download the version compatible with your CUDA Toolkit.

Extract the files and copy them to your CUDA installation directory (usually /usr/local/cuda on Linux).
Verify Installation:

Run nvidia-smi in your terminal to check if your GPU is recognized.

Use the command nvcc --version to verify CUDA installation.

Integrate with Roboflow:

Get your object detection model from Roboflow and follow their integration guide to start using it with your GPU-accelerated setup.

💡 Pro Tip: Always check for the latest versions of CUDA and cuDNN to ensure compatibility with your GPU and frameworks.

Ready to accelerate my object detection projects and push the boundaries of what's possible with computer vision! 📈✨
